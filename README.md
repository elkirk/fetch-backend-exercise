This repo contains the files necessary to run the microservice that solves the Fetch Backend Engineering exercise.

### Running the app
There are a couple of ways to run and interact with this app. These instructions assume a basic understanding of github and Python specifically. You will need Python version 3.9 or higher to run this app without errors.

#### Option 1: Run locally
Clone the repo to your local machine. This app requires a few Python libraries that are not part of the standard library and need to be installed. Install these requirements using pip (a virtual environment is recommended, but not required). From the top-level directory:

```console
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Once all required libraries are installed, run the app from the top-level directory (`fetch-backend-exercise`) with the command:
```console
uvicorn app.main:app
```

You should see something similar to the below, which indicates the app is running locally:
```console
‚ùØ uvicorn app.main:app         
INFO:     Started server process [65094]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

#### Option 2: Run with Docker
Coming soon...

### Interacting with the app
There are 4 endpoints that accept requests:
- `add-transaction` accepts POST requests representing points transactions that have the format described below and created a database entry for each:
    ```
    { "payer": "DANNON", "points": 1000, "timestamp": "2020-11-02T14:00:00Z" }
    { "payer": "UNILEVER", "points": 200, "timestamp": "2020-10-31T11:00:00Z" }
    { "payer": "DANNON", "points": -200, "timestamp": "2020-10-31T15:00:00Z" }
    { "payer": "MILLER COORS", "points": 10000, "timestamp": "2020-11-01T14:00:00Z" }
    { "payer": "DANNON", "points": 300, "timestamp": "2020-10-31T10:00:00Z" }
    ```
- `balance` accepts GET requests and returns total point balances for each payer with at least one transaction in the database.
- `spend` accepts PUT requests representing a points spend request that have the format described below. If there are enough points in the database to cover the spend, this endpoint returns JSON describing the payers and their contributions to the spend request. Points are spent oldest-to-newest. If there are not enough points to cover the request, a response will be returned with status code 422 indicating there are insufficient points.
    - Requests have the format:
    ```
    { "points": 5000 }
    ```
    - Since points are spent oldest-to-newest, the spend request described above will return the following:
    ```
    [
    {
        "payer": "DANNON",
        "points": -100
    },
    {
        "payer": "UNILEVER",
        "points": -200
    },
    {
        "payer": "MILLER COORS",
        "points": -4700
    }
    ]
    ```
    - New records will be added to the database reflecting these negative transactions.
- `check` accepts GET requests and returns a list of JSON entries representing every transaction currently stored in the database. Hitting this endpoint after the requests described above will return:
    ```
